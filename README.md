# MarkovChain
Simple Markov chain implementation for text generation and prediction
It can be ran with a text file as argument and will create an abstract graph representing of the words weighed by the probability
of words being close to each other.
From the graph the program is able to generate a random text using the words of the input text and the same law of probabily in the
words repartition.
